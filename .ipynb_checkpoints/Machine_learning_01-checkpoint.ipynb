    "__Ans:__ Linear regression is a quiet and the simplest statistical regression method used for predictive analysis in machine learning. Linear regression shows the linear relationship between the independent(predictor) variable i.e. X-axis and the dependent(output) variable i.e. Y-axis, called linear regression. Linear Regression is a machine learning algorithm based on supervised learning.\n",
